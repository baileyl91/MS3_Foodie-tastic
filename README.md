# Foodie-tastic!

[View the live project here.](https://flask-recipe-cookbook.herokuapp.com/)

This project was created as part of my Milestone Project 3 with Code Institute Web Application Development course. 

For the project and to demonstrate what I have learned in the course, have decided to create an online recipe cookbook application called ‘Foodie-tastic!’. The inspiration was provided by Code Institute in the project assessment handbook.

The main goal of the site is to be a recipe-sharing site. Allowing users to create and share their own recipes with the community.

## Design

**Color Scheme**

The site comprises two different shades of green with white text. 
The navbar and the footer would be a dark shade of green while the body is a light shade of green. 
The recipe cards would have a background color of white and the delete buttons red to identify as a danger.

**Typograpghy**

The main font I have used is the ‘Poppins’ for its clean and minimal look with the backup font as sans-serif font if there were any problems using the first choice. 

**Imagery**

The hero image was sourced from Unsplash and was chosen because I felt it captures the gathering of a community coming together to share foods as the aim of the site is for the community to share their recipes.

**Database Structure**

The database is not a relational database and was created using MongoDB. 
There are only two databases in the collection, named:

* Users
* Recipes

**Wireframes**

## Features

There are a number of features that have been implemented into the website which are:

* Navbar to allow users to navigate through the site
* Footer to store social media links 
* Social media links to connect users to the site social media
* Responsive on all devices
* Register to create an account
* View recipes created by the community show as cards
* Users can add their own recipes to the collection
* User can edit their own recipes 
* User can delete their own recipes
* Admin account created for the site owner
* Admin can add, edit or delete any recipes in the collection to keep things clean
* Search bar 
* Recipes card showing the full detail of a particular recipe

Future Implementations

There were a few more ideas that I had for the site that could be implemented in the future.

* Profile page account, showing their own collection of their own recipes
* Live count of their own recipes on the profile page.
* Live count of recipes in the community collection on the home page
* Accept images files as an alternative to URL links
* User can delete their own account
